More detail on DOSPVR command line options
------------------------------------------

-ALPHAPREFIX xxx

The image's alpha channel is loaded from a file with
the given prefix.
The prefix can be just characters or even a
full or relative path. To emulate the behavior of the
PVRCONV.EXE too, use "-ALPHAPREFIX t"


------------------------------------------

-ALPHAFILE [file]

The alpha channel is loaded from [file]. The -ALPHAPREFIX
option has a higher priority. If both are specified on the
command line, [file] will only be used if the -ALPHAPREFIX
file cannot be found or loaded.


------------------------------------------

-PAGEMIPMAP

The page mipmap option allows you to load all mipmaps from
a single bitmap. The bitmap must be laid out with the full
size mipmap at the top with each size directly underneath:

   +----------+
   |          |
   |          |
   |          |
   |          |
   +-----+----+
   |     |
   |     |
   +--+--+
   |  |
   +--+
   |_|
   #
   '

This option cannot be used with -BATCHMIPMAP.

------------------------------------------


-BATCHMIPMAP

The batch mipmap option allows you to specify your own
mipmap images. For example:

	DOSPVR foo.bmp /BATCHMIPMAP

If foo.bmp is 64x64, then the program looks for:

	foo.bmp  - 64x64
	1foo.bmp - 32x32
	2foo.bmp - 16x16
	3foo.bmp - 8x8
	4foo.bmp - 4x4
	5foo.bmp - 2x2
	6foo.bmp - 1x1

-BATCHMIPMAP and -ALPHAPREFIX can be used together, in which
case the batch prefix is appended first, followed by the alpha
prefix, for example:

	DOSPVR foo.bmp /BATCHMIPMAP /ALPHAPREFIX a

Builds the batch mipmap from:
foo.bmp + afoo.bmp, 1foo.bmp + a1foo.bmp ... Nfoo.bmp + aNfoo.bmp



------------------------------------------


-COLOURFORMAT [format]

[format] can be any one of: SMART 4444 1555 565 555 SMARTYUV YUV422 8888

SMART
The program automatically selects from 4444, 1555 or 565 depending
on the number of colours in the image's alpha channel. If the image
has no alpha, or the alpha only has one colour, it uses 565. If the
alpha only has two colours, it uses 1555. If the alpha has more than
two colours, it uses 4444.

4444
The program uses 4 bits each for R,G,B and A

1555
The program uses 5 bits for R,G,B and 1 bit for A

565
The program uses 5 bits for R & B and 6 bits for G. No alpha is
used.

555
The program uses 5 bits for R,G,B. No alpha us used.

SMARTYUV
This option behaves exactly like SMART mode, except that YUV422
mode is selected instead of 565.

YUV422
The program encodes the colour information as YUV422 [YCbYCr].
There is no alpha.

8888
Only available with palettised images. The palette is written out
as 8888.
